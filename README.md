<h1>YT PlaylistManager</h1>
==========

<p>It's a simple YouTube playlist manager which I've created just to play a bit with YT API and AngularJS.</p>

<p>For now almost everything (except buttons right under player) should work somehow but it's far from being 'bulletproof' and in some cases app throws errors.</p>

<p>I've decided to start (once more) all over again because I don't see point in struggling with this mess.</p>

<h3>TODO's</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Start app with Grunt/Yeoman (haven't decided yet),</li>
    <li>Make a nice, clear and user-friendly layout,</li>
    <li>Re-think model, factories and controllers 'cause it's real mess here now,</li>
    <li>Rewrite everything again,</li>
    <li>Fix logging system, store session,</li>
    <li>Add some effects (just to play a little with ng-animate and get smoother items loading etc),</li>
    <li>Use $location,</li>
    <li>It would be nice to manage items with drag&amp;drop,</li>
    <li>...and maybe more, who knows!</li>
</ul>

<p>So, as you can see there's a lot of work to do and I'll start immadietly on another branch (git is another thing which I need to get familiar with).</p>

<p>Here's a live demo:</p>
